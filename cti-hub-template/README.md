# McKee CTI Hub (GitHub-Only Template)

A low/zero-code Cyber Threat Intelligence hub that lives entirely in GitHub.

- **Firehose**: automated RSS pulls into `/firehose/` via GitHub Actions
- **Curated**: human-written highlights in `/curated/` (monthly/quarterly)
- **Indicators**: optional STIX/CSV/JSON IoCs in `/indicators/`
- **Tools**: helper scripts and docs

## Quick Start

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** (private or public).
2. **Upload the contents** of this template (or import it).
3. Review and edit `feeds.yaml` to match the sources you want.
4. Enable Actions (if disabled) and let the **Daily Firehose** run.
5. (Optional) Turn on **GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages) to make a browsable portal.
6. Add a Webex tab that links to your repo or Pages site.

## Curation Workflow

- The Action writes a dated markdown file in `/firehose/` each day.
- You skim the latest entries and assemble human-curated notes in `/curated/`.
- For major periods, create `/curated/2025-Q3-highlights.md` with summaries and links.
- Share the curated doc link in your Webex SecOps space.

## Webex Integration (Optional)

- Easiest: Add a Webex tab pointing at the repo or the GitHub Pages site.
- Advanced (optional): Use the provided webhook workflow to post a daily digest to Webex.
  - Set secrets: `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` and `WEBEX_ROOM_ID` (or webhook URL if you prefer).
